## Table Of Contents

* 1 . ```def differenceofSum(n,m)``` - Total of all integers ranging between 1 to n which are not divisible by m.
* 2 . ```def LargeSmallSum(arr)``` - Return the sum of the second smallest element at odd position ‘arr’ and the second largest element at the even position.
* 3 . Write a function to validate if the provided two strings are ```anagrams``` or not.
* 4 . ```def Productsmallpair(sum,arr)``` - Find the arr(j) and arr(k), where k ! = j. arr(j) and arr(k) should be the smallest elements in the array.
* 5 . ```Chats DectoNBase(int n, int num)``` - This function only uses positive integers. Use a positive integer n and num to find out the n-base that is equal to num.
* 6 . ```Int Numberofcarry(Integer num 1, Integer num 2)``` - When the sum of the digits exceeds a total of 9, a carry digit is added to the right-left of the digit.
* 7 . ```Replacecharacter(Char str1, Char ch1, Int 1, Char ch2)``` - The given function has a string (str) and two characters, ch1 and ch2. Execute the function in such a way that str returns to its original string, and all the events in ch1 are replaced by ch2, and vice versa.
* 8 . ```Int operationchoices(int c, int n, int a, int b).``` - Execute the function to get:
(a + b), if c = 1;(a / b), if c = 4;(a – b), if c = 2;(a x b), if c = 3
* 9 . ```Int calculate(int m, int n)``` - This function needs two positive integers. Calculate the sum of numbers between these two numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.
* 10 . Create a matrix and mention the elements in it. Now, divide the main matrix into two halves in such a way that the elements in index 0 are even, the elements in index 1 are odd, and so on.
* 11 . ``` Int OperationsBinarystring(char* str)``` - Input:Str: ICOCICIAOBI Explanation: The input when expanded is “1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 AND 0 OR 1”. The result becomes 1 and hence the output is 1.
